### Data Cleaning

Initially, Data was very messy and uncleaned, so we used external tools to make it ready for the Visualization. Data cleaning has been done using Jupyter Notebook and Tableau Prep. Finally, the cleaned datasets of both the cities are merged in Jupyter Notebook to get the ‘Final Dataset’ which has been used for doing the visualizations.

### Visualization Tool

Tableau has been used as the Data Visualization tool as it is a very powerful, secure and flexible end to end analytics platform where we can visualize our data quickly and easily by creating interactive dashboards and convey an overall story using storyboard. Tableau is been used predominantly in the industry for creating powerful visualizations.

Target Audience The insights drawn could be helpful for both Hosts and Users. Hosts- People putting up their place for rental purpose. Users- People searching for accommodation.

### Dashboard has been categorized into four categories-

* Overview of Airbnb

* Property analysis

* Pricing analysis

* Host analysis

---

### Findings

* Shared room is barely available.

* Entire apartment and private rooms consists of more than 95% of the total listings.
  
* Most number of listings originates from Brooklyn and Manhattan.
  
* Reason being is because these two cities are one of the most traveled destinations, therefore would have the most listing availability.

* Queens and Staten Island appear to have similar distributions.
  
* Bronx is the cheapest of them all.

* This is expected because Manhattan is one of the most expensive places to live in the world while Bronx appears to have lower standards of living.
  
* At its core is Manhattan, a densely populated that’s among the world’s major commercial, financial and cultural centers.
